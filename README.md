# Simple Cipher

This is a simple html/css/javascript project. 

The site accepts text directly or from the clipboard.  The user can then select to encrypt the text or, if its already encrypted, decrypt it. The cipher used is the Ceasar cipher; a subsitution cipher.  

The project was inspired by one of Free Code Camp's final projects in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.
